# MoSâ‚‚/UCNP Nanohybrid Photodetector

This repository contains the research on MoSâ‚‚/UCNP nanohybrid-based photodetectors, utilizing graphene as a charge transport layer. This work was published in *ACS Applied Electronic Materials*.

## ðŸ”¬ Project Overview

- **Device Structure:** Ag/Graphene/MoSâ‚‚/UCNP/SiOâ‚‚/Si
- **Mechanism:** Photodetector with MoSâ‚‚/UCNP as the active layer
- **Wavelength Range:** 405â€“1064 nm
- **Key Feature:** Enhanced photodetection with graphene-mediated charge transport

## ðŸ§ª Fabrication Summary

- Graphene was transferred onto SiOâ‚‚/Si substrates.
- MoSâ‚‚ and UCNP nanohybrids were synthesized and deposited onto the graphene layer.
- Silver electrodes were used for device contacts.
- Devices were characterized under ambient conditions using laser illumination.

## ðŸ“ˆ Measurements

- Time-dependent photoresponse (IT) under 405 nm, 532 nm, 633 nm, 808 nm, and 1064 nm lasers.
- Calculated responsivity, gain, and detectivity.
